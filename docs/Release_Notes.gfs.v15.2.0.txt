GFS v15.2.0 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE
        No change from GFS v15.1.0


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

   * NOAA Vlab GIT is used to manage GFS.v15.2 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v15.2 implementation need to have
 	permission to clone Vlab gerrit repositories.  So far Wojciech Cencek has been given access to all GFS.v15.2
 	related git repositories. Please contact Kate.Friedman@noaa.gov or Hang.Lei@noaa.gov if there is any VLAB 
        access issue and/or the individual code managers listed under item #6) below.  Please follow the following 
        steps to install the package on WCOSS DELL

  	1) cd  $NWROOTp3
	2) mkdir gfs.v15.2.0
	3) cd gfs.v15.2.0
  	4) git clone --recursive gerrit:global-workflow .
  	5) git checkout feature/dev-v15.2
  	6) cd sorc
  	7) ./checkout.sh
      	This script extracts the following GFS components from gerrit
      		MODEL -- tag nemsfv3_gfsv15.2.0 		Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
        	GSI -- tag DA_GFS_v15.2       			Russ.Treadon@noaa.gov
        	UPP -- tag ncep_post_gtg.v1.1.1   		Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
       		WAFS -- tag gfs_wafs.v5.0.9         		Yali.Mao@noaa.gov


  	8) ./build_all.sh
     	*This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for each package is written
      	to log files in directory logs. To build an individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.
  	
	9) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell

	* Note: 1) ecflow suite definition and scripts are saved in gfs.v15.2.0/ecflow/ecf
        	2) ncep_post_gtg.v1.1.1 contains restricted GTG (Graphic Turbulence Guidance) code provided by
           	NCAR.  Please do not post the GTG code in any public domain.

PRODUCT CHANGES

   * 


RESOURCE INFORMATION

   * Frequency of run
     * No change from GFS v15.1

   * Commonly used libraries, compiler, and modules are defined in gfs.v15.1.0/modulefiles. For nemsfv3gfs, gsi, upp, wafs
 	they maintain their own module files under gfs.v15.1.0/sorc/(fv3gfs gsi gfs_post global_wafs).fd/modulefiles
     * GSI updated to use bufr/11.3.0

   * Data retention time under $COMROOThps for GFS.v15.2 should be the same as GFS.v15.1.

   * Disk space:  
     * No change from GFS v15.1

   * Computational resources and run times:
     * No change from GFS v15.1


PRE-IMPLEMENTATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS

   * Which production jobs should be tested as part of this implementation?
	* The entire GFS v15.2 package needs to be installed and tested.  EMC can run the same date and compare NCO and EMC output 
          to confirm the EMC and NCO tests reproduce each other

   * Does this change require a 30-day evaluation?
  	* No.


   * Suggested evaluators
  	* Please contact fanglin.yang@noaa.gov and russ.treadon@noaa.gov for evaluation.
