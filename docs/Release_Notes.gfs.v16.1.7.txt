GFS V16.1.7 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE
 
  NOAA awarded Delivery Order 4 (DO-4) of its commercial radio occultation (RO) 
  data purchase to both Spire Global and GeoOptics on February 10, 2022.  This 
  purchase covers 5500 occultations per day from Spire and 500 occultations per 
  day from GeoOptics over a 10 month period with the data flow starting on 
  March 16, 2022.

  Both GeoOptics and Spire have been assimilated in operations as part of 
  previous delivery orders.  DO-1 was awarded to both vendors, but was used 
  for evaluation purposes only and not assimilated operationally.  DO-2 was 
  awarded to GeoOptics and subsequently assimilated in the operational GFS/GDAS 
  as v16.1.  DO-3 was then awarded to Spire only.  The v16.1.4 implementation 
  turned on the assimilation of Spire data as well as turned off the assimilation 
  of GeoOptics.  

  If no changes are made to operations, we will assimilate the Spire portion of 
  the purchase, but would not assimilate the new GeoOptics data. In order to 
  assimilate data from both vendors, a single line change in the global_convinfo.txt 
  fix file is required.  There are no other changes planned for this implementation.  
  Once data flow begins on March 16th, a one-week evaluation of the new GeoOptics 
  observations is needed before implementation.

  In addition to DO-4, a small change is needed to accompany a change in the
  observation processing.  Winds "NeXRaD VAD WINDS FROM LEVEL 2 DECODER"
  (tank b002/xx017) will soon be included in the global observation processing.
  Since these observations have not yet been evaluated in the GFS, this observation
  type (uv 224) will be set to monitor mode.  This requires a single line change
  in the global_convinfo.txt file.


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

  The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com 
  are used to manage the GFS.v16.1.6 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1.6 
  implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and 
  the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository. All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are 
  publicly readable and do not require access permissions.  Please follow the 
  following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell:

  1) cd $NWROOTp3

  2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.7

  3) cd gfs.v16.1.7

  4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.7  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .

  5) cd sorc

  6) ./checkout.sh -o
     * This script extracts the following GFS components:
         MODEL     tag GFS.v16.0.17                  Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
         GSI       tag gfsda.v16.1.6                 Catherine.Thomas@noaa.gov
         GLDAS     tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0  Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
         UFS_UTILS tag ops-gfsv16.0.0                George.Gayno@noaa.gov
         POST      tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.4     Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
         WAFS      tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.22              Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

  7) ./build_all.sh
     * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for 
       each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an 
       individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.

  8) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell	


SORC CHANGES

* sorc/
  * checkout.sh will checkout the following code changes:
    * sorc/syndat_getjtbul.fd/getjtbul.fi:
      JTWC changed the TCvitals data format (new data contains Tab and Return-Key). 
      The code update can decode the new JTWC data correctly
      * No changes to other source code.
